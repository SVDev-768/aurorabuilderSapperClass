        <description>
            <p>A dwarf charges forward toward the army of ghouls. In his hand is a small pipe, capped and sealed tightly at the ends. He throws it and it explodes on impact, setting fire to the creatures closest to the blast and rending the flesh of the others in a deadly cloud of shrapnel.</p>
            <p class="indent">A tiefling crouches before a locked door and produces a bit of grey putty and a fuse from her pouch. She inserts the putty into the lock, attaches the fuse, and lights it. After a moment there is an audible crack as a small, focused explosion destroys the locking mechanism from the inside.</p>
            <p class="indent">Sappers are members of a nameless secret society with expert knowledge of a magical, incendiary substance called "sap powder", which they use to create various explosive devices. Over time, sappers have applied their talents to mining, demolition, breaching fortifications, and even the occasional assassination.</p>
            <p class="indent">Wherever objects are exploding you will likely find a sapper.</p>
            <h4>ARCANE EXPLOSIVES</h4>
            <p>Sap powder can be dissolved in liquid or combined with other dry solids to create powerful incendiary effects. The ingredients and rituals used in the creation of this magical substance are a highly guarded secret, known only to a few in the upper echelons of the worldwide, secret sappers' society. In order to learn the formula, one must achieve a high level of knowledge and spirituality based on concepts of engineering and magical alchemy. As a result, average sappers must rely on their proficiency with a pre-assembled <strong>Sapper's Kit</strong> containing this powder in order to create their explosives.</p>
            <h4>CREATING A SAPPER</h4>
            <p>There are many potential questions to ask yourself when creating a sapper. For example, how did you get inducted into the secret order of sappers? Were you once a member of an engineering army corps?</p>
            <p>Perhaps you come from a long line of civilian engineers with an illustrious family history in the sappers' order. Now that you've been inducted, why did you begin adventuring? Were you sent out on a dark and secret mission by the local chapter of your order? Maybe going on a particular quest is necessary for you to gain the experience needed to advance into sapper leadership.</p>
            <p>As a class, Sappers tend to place a high value on learning important life lessons, conveying them through the lens of engineering analogies. Is there another sapper you look up to as a role model? Do you have a few favorite philosophical quotes? Consider how your spirituality grows as you gain experience with your explosives.</p>
            <h5>QUICK BUILD</h5>
            <p>You can make a sapper quickly by following these suggestions. First, Dexterity should be your highest ability score, followed by Constitution. Second, choose either the Acolyte, Noble, or Soldier background.</p>
            <h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>

        <description>
            <p>Vollokoff's Cocktails are the base component used in making a few different types of explosives. All explosives with a cocktail base are labeled as such within their descriptions. Cocktails and cocktail-based explosives take on the following properties:</p>
            <p class="indent">When you use a cocktail-based explosive, roll 1d20 as if you were making an attack roll. If you roll 2-5, the charge doesn't detonate. If you roll a 1, it explodes in your hand and you must make the associated Dexterity saving throw. Make the save with disadvantage but do not add any modifiers to the damage roll.</p>
            <p class="indent">Carrying cocktails is dangerous. Under certain conditions, cocktail-based explosives can accidentally detonate. When they do, all the explosives you are carrying detonate. This can happen under the following conditions:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>If you fall more than 5 feet, roll 1d10. If you roll a 1, they detonate.</li>
                <li>If you take fire damage, roll 1d20. If you roll a 1, they detonate.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When your explosives accidentally detonate, you automatically fail any saving throws imposed by them and must roll full damage for each device, with the caveat that you do not add any modifiers to any of these damage rolls and the event does not kill you outright, though it may reduce you to 0 hit points.</p>

        <description>
            <p>Starting at level 2 you can forge focus charges. A focus charge is comprised of a short fuse attached to a bit of moldable putty that can be squeezed into small holes or stuck to relatively flat surfaces.</p>
            <p class="indent">It takes a full minute to prepare a focus charge and 10 seconds for the fuse to burn before the charge detonates. Because sap takes a few hours to distill and condense into charge putty, you can only make these during a long rest.</p>
            <p class="indent">You may place multiple focus charges into a single area to increase the damage when the charge goes off. The maximum amount of focus charges you can carry at once is dictated by the Focus Charges column of the Sapper table. </p>
            <p class="indent">To use a focus charge, make an attack roll against the object you are attempting to damage or destroy. If you successfully breach the object's AC, it takes force damage equal to 3d8 + your Dexterity modifier. Add another 3d8 for every charge you stack. Because this is a precision explosion, items behind the affected object (i.e items inside a chest or behind a door) are unaffected as long as you don't roll a natural 1 on your attack roll.</p>
            <p class="indent">When a focus charge detonates, it is noisy. A loud crack can be heard 100 ft. away.</p>

            <description>A focus charge is a moldable putty that takes a full minute to prepare and has a 10 second fuse. These can only be made during long rests due to sap taking a few hours to distill and condense into a puty.
            It can be squeezed into small holes or planted on relatively flat surfaces. Multiple charges can be placed into a single area to increase damage. 
            When using a charge, make an attack roll against an object's AC, then if successful, it takes 3d8 + (Your Dex. Modifier) force damage. Repeat for each charge you stacked.
            Items behind the affected object (like items in a chest or behind a door) won't be affected by the precision explosion unless a nat 1 happens on the attack roll.
            Focus charges create a loud cracking noise that can be heard from about 100 ft. away.</description>

            <p>Beginning at level 3 you have discovered that sap is a caustic substance. It can be applied to a wound and then ignited in order to seal the flesh back together. 3 times per long rest you can cauterize a wound, either on yourself or on another creature. This technique regains hit points equal to 1d6 + your proficiency bonus and takes 5 minutes to perform.</p>

            <p>At level 5, you have learned to forge maimers - a spinoff of Vollokoff's Cocktail packed tightly inside a scored metal sheath filled with nails. Like a cocktail, it is thrown and then detonates on impact. When it explodes, it does so in a 20 ft cube centered on a point you choose within range.</p>
            <p class="indent">Creatures within the innermost 10 ft. of the cube take 2d8 fire damage + 2d8 piercing damage. Creatures in the outer area take only 2d8 piercing damage. All creatures in the affected area make a Dexterity saving throw and take only half damage if they succeed.</p>
            <p class="indent">Maimers take a few hours to build so it takes 2 long rests to make them, though you can make many simultaneously. The maximum amount of maimers you can carry at once is dictated by the Maimers column of the Sapper table. </p>

            <p>At level 7 you have learned to control the timing of your detonations and can now forge tickers - another cocktail spinoff using adhesive and an extra ingredient that begins dissolving once the ticker is placed. Once the solution reaches a particular alchemical state due to the dissolving ingredient, the ticker detonates. </p>
            <p class="indent">You may affix up to 3 tickers onto surfaces, objects, or creatures you can reach while taking movement, or in place of your movement.

            <p class="indent">All creatures in the affected area make a Dexterity saving throw, taking fire damage (or your mixin damage type) equal to 1d12 + your dexterity modifier on a failed save or half as much on a successful one. If blast areas overlap, creatures within overlapping blast areas must make saving throws and associated damage rolls for each blast contributing to the overlap.</p>
            <p class="indent">If you affix a ticker to a creature's body, it makes a Wisdom saving throw (DC equal to 15 + your proficiency bonus) at the beginning of its turn. On a failed save, it does not notice you have placed an explosive on its body and it automatically fails the Dexterity save when the device detonates.</p>
            <p class="indent">Tickers do not explode on impact if thrown. They can be made during a long or short rest. The maximum amount of tickers you can carry at once is dictated by the Cocktails &amp; Tickers column of the Sapper table.</p>

            <p><b>Smoke Grenade</b></p>
            <p>A cloud of black smoke appears in a 40 ft. cube centered on a point you choose within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for 1 minute or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses it.</p>
            <p><b>Pressure Wave</b></p>
            <p>Creatures within a 15 ft. cone beginning at a point you choose within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature is pushed back 15 ft. and is knocked prone. On a successful save, it is pushed back 5 ft. and is not prone.</p>
